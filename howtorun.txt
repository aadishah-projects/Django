1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**: Launch your terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where your Django project is located. 
   - Example: 
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Activate your virtual environment to ensure all dependencies are correctly loaded.
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Run Database Migrations (if necessary)**:
   - Ensure your database is up to date with the latest migrations.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

5. **Start the Django Development Server**:
   - Start the server with the following command:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - By default, this will run the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and go to the URL provided by the server (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`).

You can modify or add any additional steps specific to your project!
